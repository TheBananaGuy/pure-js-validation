# Form validation using raw JavaScript with PHP

Very simple project that touches the following aspects:
- Practicing and excercising the forgotten arts for own benefit.
- Making registration the way they did it back in 2011. With salt... And pepper... And md5 hashing, of course.
- Helping out a dude by explaining some basics he wanted to know.

## TODO:

- Better styling
- Ajax implementation
- Better backend error messages through session
- Login form to test your login
